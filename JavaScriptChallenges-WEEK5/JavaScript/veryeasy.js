// VERY EASY: What is the difference between the following 
// JavaScript keywords: var, let and const.  Please provide 
// a written explanation. You are able to include a code 
// reference along with your written explanation for each keyword.

// var is not block scoped, which means it can be accessed (and mutated) in or outside of a block or {}. Also,
//  var doesn't have to be assigned a variable when declared unlike 'let' and 'const'.

// let is block scoped, which means if it is declared inside a block it can NOT be accessed (or mutated) outside of the block.

// const is also a block scoped variable, it defines a constant REFERENCE to a value. The primitive values can NOT be mutuated.
